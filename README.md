# Welcome to the Pokemon Game repository!

In this repository, you will find the files for a Pokemon-themed game created with RPG Maker XP in 2017. The game features an engaging storyline and a variety of Pokemon to catch and battle, as well as a variety of items and trainers to interact with. You may notice references to Hearthstone and Washington State locations in trainer dialogue and names throughout the game.

To get started, simply download the repository to your local machine and run the executable file. The game will launch in a new window, and you can navigate through it using the arrow keys and interact with objects and characters by pressing the space bar.

Looking towards the future, we hope to upgrade the game to the latest version of RPG Maker XP's Essentials package and incorporate custom Ruby scripts to enhance gameplay and features. However, this game is a work in progress and updates may not be immediately available.
